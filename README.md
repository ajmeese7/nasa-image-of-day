Different `Images of the Day` for Wallpaper Engine.

These images are not always perfectly made to fit as a wallpaper, so sometimes they
are stretched to fit the screen or centered while remaining unstretched. This cannot
be perfectly fixed because I do not control the images released on these sources.

Options currently include:
- [Astronomy](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html)
- [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/iotd.html)
- [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography/photo-of-the-day/)

Available for Wallpaper Engine on Steam [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1563729818).
